Laser - Basic

This asset is a basic all in one laser script that works with a custom additive mask shader and line renderer and RayCast to create any variation of thin low performance cost laser. The script allows to attach a source or end flare and or enable lights to enhance the effect. A UV texture scrolling direction control is also available to simulate dust.

-	Flares auto respond to camera distance over 20 and angle to source object of more then 155 degrees
-	Perfect for gun sight lasers
-	Comes with laser pointer prefab
-	2D environment compatible

This asset also works well with Unity standard Bloom post effect to enhance the laser lighting effect (Bloom is Unity Pro Only) 


Custom Shader: LaserAdditive

Main Color – Main Color

Mask (A) – Mask Texture alpha controls the overall texture alpha fade masking (texture alpha channel controls material cutoff)

Pattern (A) – Texture alpha controls secondary alpha (texture alpha channel controls material cutoff)

Alpha Cutoff – Controls the amount of alpha cutoff


Script: Laser

Start Point – Assign Staring point of laser. Laser only uses local Z axis (Vector3.forward) as its direction (cannot be left blank)
Laser Direction – direction of laser from start point (X, Y, Z only)
Use 2D – Switch 2D mode on and off
Layer 2D Mask– Adjust the 2D sort layer of the 
Laser On – Turn just laser on and off
UseUVPan – Enable texture pan
End Flare Offset – Controls the end flare and end light offset 
Source Flare – Source Flare Slot (optional)
End Flare - Source Flare Slot (optional)
Add Source Light – Auto Creates a light at beginning of laser (optional as it will cost a draw call)
Add End Light - Auto Creates a light at beginning of laser (optional as it will cost a draw call)
Laser Color – Change all laser, flare and light color realtime
Start Width – Controls start width
End Width - Controls end width
Laser Dist – Controls the distance of the laser
TexScrollX – controls the speed the texture pans in X axis (only works with shader above)
TexScrollY - controls the speed the texture pans in Y axis (only works with shader above)
UV Tex Scale - controls the U and V scale of the assigned texture (only works with shader above)
